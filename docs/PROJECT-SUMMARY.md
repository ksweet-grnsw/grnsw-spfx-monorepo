# GRNSW SPFx Monorepo Project Summary

## Executive Summary

This monorepo consolidates all SharePoint Framework solutions for Greyhound Racing NSW into a single, well-organized repository with shared services and independent deployment capabilities.

## Key Accomplishments

### 1. Monorepo Migration
- Successfully migrated from single package (`full-weather-data-spfx`) to organized monorepo
- Created four domain-specific packages with shared services
- Implemented npm workspaces for efficient dependency management

### 2. Package Structure

#### Created Packages:
1. **@grnsw/shared** - Common services (auth, Dataverse, logging)
2. **@grnsw/track-conditions-spfx** - Weather and track monitoring (formerly weather-spfx)
3. **@grnsw/race-management-spfx** - Race meetings and results
4. **@grnsw/greyhound-health-spfx** - Health and injury tracking
5. **@grnsw/gap-spfx** - Greyhound Adoption Program

### 3. Recent Feature Updates

#### Race Meetings Calendar Enhancement (v1.8.0)
- **Problem**: Month view showed small dots that were hard to see and provided limited information
- **Solution**: Replaced dots with colored rectangles containing track names
- **Impact**: Improved usability and information visibility

### 4. Infrastructure Improvements

#### Version Management
- Independent versioning per package
- Automated release script
- Organized release artifacts in `/releases` directory
- Git tagging strategy for releases

#### Documentation
- Comprehensive development guide
- Package-specific READMEs
- Quick start guide for new developers
- Detailed changelog and migration guide
