# GRNSW GAP SPFx Web Parts - v1.3.0

**Release Date:** December 12, 2024

## Overview
This release fixes the critical field name issue that was preventing data from loading from the GAP Dataverse environment.

## ðŸŽ¯ Critical Fix in v1.3.0
- **Fixed Primary Key Field Name:** Changed from `cr0d3_houndsid` to `cr0d3_houndid`
  - The error was: `"Could not find a property named 'cr0d3_houndsid' on type 'Microsoft.Dynamics.CRM.cr0d3_hound'"`
  - Dataverse uses singular form for the primary key: `cr0d3_houndid`
  - This was causing 400 Bad Request errors on all API calls

## âœ… What's Working Now
- API calls to Dataverse should succeed
- Greyhounds should display in the data grid
- Search and filtering should function properly
- Test API button should show actual record counts

## ðŸ“‹ Features
### Hound Search Web Part
Advanced search and filtering capabilities for greyhounds in the adoption program:
- **Search by:** Name, microchip number, or ear brand
- **Filter by:**
  - Adoption status (available/adopted)
  - Sex (Male/Female)
  - Desexed status
  - C5 vaccination status
- **Data Grid Display:** Professional table with sorting and pagination
- **Performance:** Optimized OData queries with field selection
