# Track Conditions SPFx v2.2.28 Deployment Instructions

## Issue Fixed
The web parts were trying to load JavaScript files from localhost (ERR_CONNECTION_REFUSED) because the previous deployment used a debug build. This production build includes all assets bundled within the .sppkg file.

## Package Details
- **File:** `track-conditions-spfx-v2.2.28-20250904.sppkg`
- **Size:** 3.6 MB (includes all bundled JavaScript/CSS assets)
- **Version:** 2.2.28
- **Build Date:** 2025-09-04

## Deployment Steps

### 1. Upload to SharePoint App Catalog
1. Navigate to: https://grnsw21.sharepoint.com/sites/appcatalog
2. Click on "Apps for SharePoint" library
3. Upload the file: `releases/track-conditions-spfx-v2.2.28-20250904.sppkg`
4. When prompted, check "Make this solution available to all sites"
5. Click "Deploy"

### 2. Update Existing Installation
If the previous version is already installed:
1. The upload will prompt "A file with this name already exists"
2. Choose "Replace existing file"
3. SharePoint will automatically update all sites using this app

### 3. Verify Deployment
1. Navigate to a site with the Historical Pattern Analyzer web part
2. Hard refresh the page (Ctrl+F5)
3. Check browser console - there should be NO localhost requests
4. The web part should load without "[object Object]" errors

## What's Different in This Build?
- **Production Build:** Built with `gulp bundle --ship && gulp package-solution --ship`
- **Bundled Assets:** All JavaScript/CSS files are embedded in the .sppkg
- **No CDN Required:** Assets load directly from SharePoint
- **Error Handling:** Enhanced ErrorBoundary component for better error messages

## Rollback Instructions
If issues occur:
1. Previous versions are available in the releases folder
2. Upload the previous version following the same steps
3. SharePoint will downgrade automatically

## Technical Notes
- Build configuration: `includeClientSideAssets: true` in package-solution.json
- No external CDN configured (cdnBasePath is not set)
- All assets minified and bundled for production use
