# Race Management SPFx v1.0.9 Release

**Release Date:** December 19, 2024

## 🐛 Bug Fixes

### Fixed Multi-Select Dropdown Using Correct Fluent UI Approach
- **Previous Issue:** Multiple attempts to fix multi-select dropdown functionality were unsuccessful
- **Root Cause:** Not correctly using the `option.selected` property that Fluent UI provides
- **Solution:** 
  - Now properly uses `option.selected` boolean property to determine selection state
  - When `option.selected` is true, the item is being selected
  - When `option.selected` is false, the item is being deselected
  - Removed preventDefault and other workarounds that were interfering
- **Result:** Multi-select dropdowns should now work as originally intended

## 📋 Technical Details

### Changes Made:
1. **Corrected dropdown onChange handlers** in `RaceMeetings.tsx`:
   - Simplified logic to rely on `option.selected` property
   - Removed preventDefault calls that were attempting to keep dropdown open
   - Uses straightforward add/remove logic based on selection state

2. **Implementation Details**:
   ```typescript
   // Correct approach:
   if (option.selected) {
     // Add the item to selection
     newItems = [...currentItems, item];
   } else {
     // Remove the item from selection
     newItems = currentItems.filter(i => i !== item);
   }
   ```
