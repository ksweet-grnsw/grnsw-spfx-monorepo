# Race Management v1.5.0 Release

**Release Date:** August 18, 2025  
**Package:** race-management-spfx.sppkg  
**SharePoint Framework Version:** 1.21.1

## üéØ Major Changes

### Icon System Overhaul
- **Enhanced SVG Icons**: All action icons updated with improved visibility
  - Health icon: Increased stroke width to 3px and scaled up 20% for better visibility
  - Details icon: Thicker lines (stroke-width: 2px) for improved clarity
  - Down arrow icon: Consistent styling with other icons
- **Dynamic Color System**: Icons now use CSS filters for hover states (gray to blue transition)

### Table Field Corrections
- **Race Title Display**: Fixed races table to use the correct `cr616_racetitle` field instead of the combined race number/name field
- **Clean UI**: Removed redundant injury indicators from name columns since dedicated injury columns now exist

## ‚ú® New Features

### 1. Dedicated Injury Columns
- All tables (meetings, races, contestants) now have dedicated injury indicator columns
- Visual health/cross icons clearly show injury status
- Tooltips provide context-specific information

### 2. Improved Icon Visibility
- Health indicator icon enhanced with:
  - 3px stroke width for all paths
  - 20% scale increase via transform
  - Maintained aspect ratio and centering
- Details icon improved with thicker, more visible lines
- Consistent icon styling across all tables

## üêõ Bug Fixes

### Field Mapping Issues
- **Fixed**: Races table was displaying combined "Race X - Name" format
- **Solution**: Now correctly uses `cr616_racetitle` field for clean title display
- **Impact**: Cleaner, more professional race title presentation

### UI Redundancy
- **Fixed**: Duplicate injury indicators appearing in both name and dedicated columns
