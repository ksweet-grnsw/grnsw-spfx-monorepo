# Race Management SPFx v1.0.5 Release

**Release Date:** December 19, 2024

## üêõ Bug Fixes

### Fixed Multi-Select Dropdown Functionality
- **Issue:** Authority and Track dropdown filters were closing immediately when selecting checkboxes, preventing multiple selections
- **Solution:** Updated the onChange event handlers to properly toggle selections based on current state
- **Impact:** Users can now select multiple authorities and tracks using the checkboxes as intended

## üìã Technical Details

### Changes Made:
1. **Modified dropdown onChange handlers** in `RaceMeetings.tsx`:
   - Changed from using `option.selected` property to checking current state
   - Used `indexOf()` instead of `includes()` for ES5 compatibility
   - Added `notifyOnReselect={true}` to keep dropdowns open during selection

2. **Updated TypeScript configuration**:
   - Added 'es2015' to lib array in tsconfig.json for better array method support

### Build Information:
- Built with `gulp bundle --ship` and `gulp package-solution --ship`
- SharePoint Framework version: 1.21.1
- Node version: 22.17.1
- TypeScript version: 4.7.4

### Known Issues:
- ESLint warnings for `any` types and `void` operators (non-critical)
- These warnings do not affect functionality
