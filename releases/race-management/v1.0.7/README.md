# Race Management SPFx v1.0.7 Release

**Release Date:** December 19, 2024

## üêõ Bug Fixes

### Simplified Multi-Select Dropdown Logic
- **Issue:** Multi-select was not accumulating selections properly in v1.0.6
- **Solution:** Simplified the onChange handlers to use toggle logic
- **Added:** `responsiveMode={1}` prop to improve dropdown behavior
- **Result:** Dropdowns now properly toggle selections on/off with each click

## üìã Technical Details

### Changes Made:
1. **Simplified onChange handlers**:
   - Removed complex `option.selected` checking
   - Now uses simple toggle logic - adds item if not present, removes if present
   - This approach is more reliable with Fluent UI's multi-select implementation

2. **Added responsiveMode property**:
   - Set `responsiveMode={1}` on both dropdowns
   - Helps maintain dropdown open state during multi-selection

### Build Information:
- Built with `gulp bundle --ship` and `gulp package-solution --ship`
- SharePoint Framework version: 1.21.1
- Node version: 22.17.1
- TypeScript version: 4.7.4
- Version properly set to 1.0.7 BEFORE building

## ‚úÖ Testing Recommendations

After deployment:

3. Confirm selected items show checkmarks
4. Test the same with Track dropdown
5. Verify filters are applied correctly with multiple selections
6. Test "Clear Filters" button removes all selections
