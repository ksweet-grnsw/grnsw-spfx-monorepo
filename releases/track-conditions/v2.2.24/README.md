# Track Conditions SPFx - Release v2.2.24

## Release Date
January 8, 2025

## Release Type
Feature Enhancement

## Changes in This Release

### Enhanced Visual Feedback for Track Conditions Analysis

#### Dynamic Color System for Safety Metrics
Modified the Track Safety and Visibility circular gauges to use a dynamic red-amber-green warning system based on percentage values:

- **Green Zone (70-100%)**: Safe conditions - displayed in green (#4CAF50)
- **Amber Zone (50-69%)**: Caution required - displayed in amber/orange (#FF9800)  
- **Red Zone (0-49%)**: Warning/dangerous conditions - displayed in red (#F44336)

This provides immediate visual feedback about track conditions:
- Track Safety circle now changes color based on grip level and safety score
- Visibility circle now changes color based on visibility percentage
- Removes static colors (was green for safety, blue for visibility)

### Technical Implementation
- Added `getGaugeColor()` method to calculate appropriate color based on percentage
- Modified `renderGauge()` method to use dynamic color calculation
- Removed hardcoded color parameters from gauge rendering calls

## Files Modified
- `src/webparts/trackConditions/components/TrackConditions.tsx`
