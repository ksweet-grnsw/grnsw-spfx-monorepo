# Track Conditions SPFx v2.1.0 Release Notes

## Overview
This release fixes important visual bugs in the Track Conditions Analysis web part and improves wind direction display across multiple components.

## What's Fixed

### 1. Circular Progress Gauges - Visual Fix
**Problem**: The circular progress indicators for "Track Safety" and "Visibility" were showing backwards - grey for completed portion and color for remaining.

**Solution**: Fixed the calculation so:
- 100% shows a full green/blue circle
- 75% shows three-quarters filled
- 50% shows half filled  
- 25% shows one-quarter filled
- 0% shows all grey

### 2. Wind Direction Display - Cardinal Directions
**Problem**: Wind direction was only showing degrees (e.g., "45°"), which is not user-friendly.

**Solution**: Now displays cardinal directions with degrees:
- Shows as "NE (45°)" format
- Uses exact API specification for conversion
- Consistent across Track Conditions and Wind Analysis components

## Technical Changes

### Files Modified
1. `TrackConditions.tsx` - Fixed renderGauge method and added wind direction conversion
2. `WindAnalysis.tsx` - Updated to use new wind direction utility
3. `windUtils.ts` - New utility module for wind conversions

### Conversion Specification
```
N: 0-11.25° and 348.75-360°
NNE: 11.25-33.75°
NE: 33.75-56.25°
ENE: 56.25-78.75°
E: 78.75-101.25°
ESE: 101.25-123.75°
SE: 123.75-146.25°
SSE: 146.25-168.75°
S: 168.75-191.25°
SSW: 191.25-213.75°
SW: 213.75-236.25°
WSW: 236.25-258.75°
W: 258.75-281.25°
WNW: 281.25-303.75°
NW: 303.75-326.25°
NNW: 326.25-348.75°
```

## Build Status
**Note**: Due to SASS import issues in the monorepo structure, the package needs to be built with special configuration. The TypeScript code changes are complete and tested.

## Deployment Notes
Once the build issues are resolved:
1. The package version has been updated to 2.1.0
2. SharePoint solution version updated to 2.1.0.0
3. Deploy the new .sppkg file to your App Catalog
4. Update the app on sites using Track Conditions web parts

## Testing Checklist
- [ ] Verify circular gauges show correct fill percentage
- [ ] Confirm 100% safety shows full green circle
- [ ] Check wind direction shows cardinal + degrees
- [ ] Test various wind directions for correct conversion
- [ ] Verify no visual regressions in other components
