- 🟡 **Important** - Significant value, plan for implementation
- 🟢 **Nice to Have** - Good improvements when time permits

---

## 🎯 Performance & User Experience

### 1. Loading States and Feedback 🔴
**Current Issue:** Users don't get feedback during data operations
**Recommendations:**
- Implement skeleton loaders for tables while data loads
- Add progress indicators for multi-step operations
- Use optimistic UI updates for better perceived performance
- Show loading spinners on buttons during actions

**Implementation Approach:**
```typescript
// Example skeleton loader component
const TableSkeleton = () => (
  <div className={styles.skeleton}>
    {[...Array(5)].map((_, i) => (
      <div key={i} className={styles.skeletonRow} />
    ))}
  </div>
);
```

### 2. Data Caching Strategy 🔴
**Current Issue:** Repeated API calls for the same data
**Recommendations:**
- Cache recently viewed data in session storage
- Implement stale-while-revalidate pattern
- Pre-fetch likely next data (predictive loading)
- Add cache invalidation on data updates

**Implementation Approach:**
```typescript
// Simple cache service
class CacheService {
  private cache = new Map();
  private ttl = 5 * 60 * 1000; // 5 minutes
  
  set(key: string, data: any) {
    this.cache.set(key, {
      data,
      timestamp: Date.now()
    });
  }
  
  get(key: string) {
    const cached = this.cache.get(key);
    if (cached && Date.now() - cached.timestamp < this.ttl) {
      return cached.data;
    }
    return null;
  }
}
```

### 3. Keyboard Navigation 🟡
**Current Issue:** Mouse-only navigation
**Recommendations:**
- Arrow keys for table navigation
- Enter to drill down
- Escape to go back
- Tab through filters
- Keyboard shortcuts (Alt+F for filter, etc.)
