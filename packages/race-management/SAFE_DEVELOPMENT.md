# Safe Development Process for Race Management SPFx

## Current Stable Version: 1.5.24

## Known Issues Fixed
- **Session Storage Quota Exceeded** (v1.5.24): Cache service now gracefully handles storage quota errors
- **Injury API Overload** (v1.5.23): Temporarily disabled injury checking to ensure stability

## Safe Development Guidelines

### 1. Before Making Changes
- [ ] Ensure current version is working in production
- [ ] Create a backup of the current working version
- [ ] Document the current version number
- [ ] Test the web part locally first

### 2. Making Changes Safely

#### Minimal Change Principle
- Make ONE change at a time
- Test after EACH change
- Build and verify after each modification
- Don't combine multiple features in one version

#### Version Control
```bash
# Always increment version before building
# Update BOTH files:
- package.json
- config/package-solution.json (both solution and feature versions)
```

#### Testing Checklist
- [ ] Data loads without errors
- [ ] No console errors (check browser DevTools)
- [ ] Performance is acceptable (< 3 second load time)
- [ ] Memory usage is stable (check Performance tab)
- [ ] Works with large datasets (100+ meetings)

### 3. Common Pitfalls to Avoid

#### Storage Issues
- **Problem**: Session/Local storage quota exceeded
- **Solution**: Use memory cache for large datasets
- **Implementation**: Already fixed in CacheService.ts v1.5.24

#### API Overload
- **Problem**: Too many concurrent API calls
- **Solution**: Implement throttling and batching
- **Status**: Needs proper implementation (currently disabled)

#### Loading State Issues
- **Problem**: Data fetches but doesn't display
- **Solution**: Ensure loading states are properly managed
- **Check**: useDataFetching hook implementation

### 4. Safe Feature Addition Process

```typescript
// 1. Add feature flag first
const ENABLE_NEW_FEATURE = false; // Start disabled

// 2. Implement behind flag
if (ENABLE_NEW_FEATURE) {
  // New feature code
}

// 3. Test thoroughly
// 4. Enable in next version
```

### 5. Build Process

```bash
# Clean build for production
cd packages/race-management
gulp clean
gulp bundle --ship
gulp package-solution --ship

# Copy to releases
mkdir -p releases/race-management/v[VERSION]
cp sharepoint/solution/race-management-spfx.sppkg releases/race-management/v[VERSION]/
```

### 6. Rollback Process

If issues occur after deployment:
1. Deploy previous working version immediately
2. Document what went wrong
3. Fix in development environment
4. Test extensively before re-deploying

### 7. Current Component Status

| Component | Status | Notes |
|-----------|--------|-------|
| Race Data Explorer | ✅ Stable | v1.5.24 - Cache fixes applied |
| Injury Checking | ⚠️ Disabled | Needs throttling implementation |
| Cache Service | ✅ Fixed | Handles quota errors gracefully |
| Search | ✅ Working | No known issues |
| Filters | ✅ Working | No known issues |

### 8. Future Improvements (Implement Carefully)

1. **Re-enable Injury Checking**
   - Add request throttling (max 2 concurrent)
   - Implement timeout (10 seconds max)
   - Cache results aggressively
   - Only check on-demand (button click)

2. **Optimize Caching**
   - Implement data compression
   - Add cache size monitoring
   - Clear old entries automatically

3. **Performance Monitoring**
   - Add timing metrics
   - Monitor API call counts
   - Track error rates

### 9. Emergency Contacts

- Previous stable versions:
  - v1.5.17: Last version before injury feature
  - v1.5.23: Reverted to stable, injury disabled
  - v1.5.24: Current with cache fixes

### 10. Testing Commands

```bash
# Local testing
gulp serve

# Type checking
npx tsc --noEmit

# Bundle analysis
gulp bundle-analytics
```

## Remember
- **Small changes** are safer than big changes
- **Test everything** before deploying
- **Monitor console** for errors after deployment
- **Keep backups** of working versions
- **Document issues** as they occur
