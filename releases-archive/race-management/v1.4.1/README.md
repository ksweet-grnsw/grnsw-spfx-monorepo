# Race Management SPFx Package v1.4.1

**Release Date:** December 17, 2024  
**Package:** race-management-spfx.sppkg  
**SharePoint Version:** SPFx 1.21.1

## üêõ Bug Fixes

### Critical Fixes
- **Fixed JSON parsing error** that prevented data from loading ("Unexpected end of JSON input")
- **Fixed missing WebPartContext** in RaceDataService causing authentication failures
- **Resolved UI layout issues** where filters were stacking vertically instead of displaying horizontally
- **Fixed missing search buttons** - Added Search and Clear buttons to the search bar
- **Added all 18 NSW greyhound tracks** to the track filter dropdown (previously only showed 4)
- **Normalized track names** - "Wentworth" now correctly maps to "Wentworth Park"

### Technical Improvements
- Enhanced error handling in RaceDataService with proper empty response handling
- Added text parsing before JSON parsing to handle edge cases
- Improved context passing from RaceDataExplorer to service layer
- Added proper CSS classes for filter layout (filterBar, filterContent, filterSelect)
- Excluded test files from production builds to reduce TypeScript errors
