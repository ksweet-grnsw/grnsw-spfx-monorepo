# Race Management SPFx Package - v1.1.38

## Release Date
December 12, 2024

## üö® Major New Feature: Injury Filtering and Tracking

### Comprehensive Injury Management System
This release introduces a powerful injury filtering system that allows users to:
- **Filter meetings by injuries**: Show only meetings where injuries occurred
- **Category-based filtering**: Filter by injury severity (Cat A through Cat E)
- **Visual injury indicators**: See injury counts directly in meeting and race lists
- **Smart defaults**: Cat D and Cat E (serious injuries) are selected by default

## New Features

### 1. Injury Filter Button
- **Toggle Filter**: New "Show Injuries" button in the filter bar
- **Active State**: Orange highlight when injury filter is active
- **Quick Access**: Instantly filter to show only meetings with reported injuries

### 2. Injury Category Selection
- **5 Categories**: Cat A, Cat B, Cat C, Cat D, Cat E
- **Default Selection**: Cat D and Cat E (serious injuries) pre-selected
- **Visual Distinction**: Serious categories (D & E) shown in red text
- **Flexible Filtering**: Toggle any combination of categories

### 3. Visual Injury Indicators

#### In Meeting List:
- **Red Warning (‚ö†Ô∏è)**: Shows count of serious injuries (Cat D/E)
- **Orange Warning (‚ö†Ô∏è)**: Shows count of minor injuries (Cat A/B/C)
- **Inline Display**: Injury counts appear next to track names
- **Hover Details**: Tooltips show injury category breakdown

#### In Race List:
- **Race-level Indicators**: Red warning icon for races with injuries
- **Count Display**: Shows number of injuries per race
- **Smart Positioning**: Icons appear next to race numbers

### 4. Backend Integration
- **Cross-environment Queries**: Fetches injury data from Injury Data environment
- **Efficient Caching**: Injury summaries cached during session
- **Real-time Updates**: Injury indicators update when filters change

## How It Works

1. Click the "Show Injuries" button in the filter bar
2. Select injury categories to include (default: Cat D & E)
3. Click "Apply" to see only meetings with injuries

### Understanding Injury Categories:
- **Cat A**: Minor injuries, quick recovery
- **Cat B**: Moderate injuries, short stand-down
- **Cat C**: Significant injuries, medium recovery
- **Cat D**: Serious injuries, extended recovery
- **Cat E**: Critical injuries, career-impacting

### Drilling Down to Injuries:
