# Race Management SPFx v1.0.6 Release

**Release Date:** December 19, 2024

## üêõ Bug Fixes

### Improved Multi-Select Dropdown Functionality
- **Previous Issue (v1.0.5):** Dropdowns stayed open but only allowed single selection
- **Root Cause:** The onChange handler was not properly using the `option.selected` property provided by Fluent UI
- **Solution:** 
  - Corrected the onChange handlers to properly check `option.selected` property
  - Now correctly adds items when `option.selected === true`
  - Properly removes items when `option.selected === false`
  - Removed `notifyOnReselect` prop that was interfering with multi-select behavior

## üìã Technical Details

### Changes Made:
1. **Updated dropdown onChange handlers** in `RaceMeetings.tsx`:
   - Now properly uses `option.selected` to determine if item is being selected or deselected
   - Prevents duplicate additions to selection array
   - Correctly accumulates multiple selections

2. **Dropdown Configuration**:
   - Removed `notifyOnReselect={true}` prop that was causing issues
   - Kept `multiSelect` and `multiSelectDelimiter` properties
