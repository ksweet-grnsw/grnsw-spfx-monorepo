# Race Management SPFx Package - v1.1.40

## Release Date
December 12, 2024

## Critical Fix - Injury Data Query

### Fixed Issue from v1.1.39
**Injury Filter Not Loading Data**: The injury filter was querying using `cra5e_injured eq true` but this field appears to always be false or null in the Injury Data environment. Changed to query directly on the `cra5e_injuryclassification` field instead.

### Technical Changes
1. **Modified injury detection logic**:
   - Changed from: `cra5e_injured eq true`
   - Changed to: `cra5e_injuryclassification ne null` (or specific category filters)
   - Applied to all injury-related methods:
     - `getMeetingsWithInjuries()`
     - `getInjurySummaryForMeeting()`
     - `getInjuriesForRace()`
     - `hasInjuries()`

2. **Enhanced diagnostic test method**:
   - Added comprehensive Test 0 to check ALL health check records
   - Shows count of injured vs not injured vs null values
   - Displays first 5 records for analysis
   - Tests different query approaches to find injury data
   - Tests specific classification searches (Cat A through E)

### What This Fixes
- Injury filter should now properly load data when classifications exist
- "Show Injuries" button will display meetings with injury classifications
- Category filters (A, B, C, D, E) will properly filter results

### Diagnostic Output
The enhanced test will show:
- Total health checks in the system
- Breakdown of injured flag values (true/false/null)
- Classification counts by category
- Sample records for verification
- Alternative query methods tested

## Features from Previous Versions
- Two-row filter layout to prevent UI overflow
- Comprehensive injury filtering system
- Visual injury indicators on meetings and races
- Category-based filtering (Cat A through E)
- Default selection of serious injuries (Cat D & E)

## Testing Instructions
1. Deploy the package to SharePoint
2. Click the blue "Test Data" button to run diagnostics
3. Check browser console for detailed output
4. Look for records with injury classifications (not relying on injured flag)
5. Test the "Injuries" button to see if data loads

## Known Issues
- Build includes warnings from Enterprise UI utilities (safe to ignore)
- Console logging is included for debugging - will be removed once confirmed working

## Dependencies
- Requires access to Racing Data and Injury Data environments
- Azure AD authentication for both environments
- Health check data must have injury classifications populated

## Installation
1. Upload the .sppkg file to your SharePoint App Catalog
2. Deploy the solution
3. Add the Race Data Explorer web part to your SharePoint pages
4. Use the "Test Data" button to verify data availability

## Console Output to Expect
When clicking "Test Data", you should see:
```
=== COMPREHENSIVE HEALTH CHECK DATA TEST ===

üìä Test 0 - Checking if ANY health check data exists:
Total health checks found: [number]
  - Injured: [count]
  - Not Injured: [count]
  - Null/Undefined: [count]
  - Classifications found: {Cat A: X, Cat B: Y, ...}

üîç Test 1 - Getting injured health checks:
Found [number] injured health checks

üè• Test 3 - Alternative Injury Detection Methods:
Found [number] records with injury classification
```

This will help identify if the issue is data availability or query logic.
