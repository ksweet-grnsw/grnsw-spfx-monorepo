# Race Management SPFx Package - v1.1.36

## Release Date
December 12, 2024

## New Features
### Parent Greyhound Navigation
- **Clickable Sire/Dam Links**: When viewing greyhound details, if the sire or dam exists in the database, their names become clickable buttons
- **Smart Name Display**: Instead of showing ID numbers, the modal now displays the actual greyhound names for sire and dam when found
- **Navigation History**: Added back button to return to previous greyhound when navigating through family trees
- **Unlimited Genealogy Depth**: Users can navigate through multiple generations of greyhounds (parents, grandparents, etc.)

## Improvements from v1.1.35
- **Better Data Display**: Sire and Dam fields now show greyhound names instead of IDs when parent data is available
- **Enhanced Navigation**: Back button shows the name of the previous greyhound for clarity
- **Seamless Parent Exploration**: Users can explore entire family trees without losing context

## Features Included from Previous Versions

## How Parent Navigation Works
- When viewing a greyhound's details, the system automatically checks if the sire and dam exist in the database
- If found, their names are displayed as clickable links with an arrow (â†’) indicator
- Clicking a parent's name opens their greyhound details modal
- A back button appears allowing users to return to the previous greyhound
- Users can navigate through multiple generations seamlessly

## Breaking Changes
None

## Known Issues
- Build includes warnings from Enterprise UI utility classes (these can be safely ignored)

## Dependencies
- Requires access to both Racing Data and Injury Data Dataverse environments
