# Race Management SPFx v1.0.12 Release

**Release Date:** December 19, 2024

## ðŸŽ¯ CRITICAL BUG FIX - Multi-Select Dropdowns

### Fixed: Multi-Select Dropdowns Now Work Properly
- **Root Cause Identified:** The web part was storing multiple selections as a comma-separated string (e.g., "QLD,VIC,NSW") but then treating that entire string as a single array element
- **The Fix:** 
  - When loading saved selections from web part properties, now properly splits the comma-separated string into an array
  - This ensures the Dataverse API receives correct filter queries with OR conditions
  - Removed duplicate selections that were accumulating

## ðŸ“‹ Technical Details

### The Problem (v1.0.5-1.0.11):
- When multiple items were selected, they were stored as: `"QLD,VIC,NSW"`
- On reload, this became: `["QLD,VIC,NSW"]` (single element array)
- This generated invalid API filter: `cr4cc_authority eq 'QLD,VIC,NSW'`
- Result: No data returned because no single authority matches that entire string

### The Solution (v1.0.12):
```typescript
// Before (wrong):
selectedAuthorities: props.selectedAuthority ? [props.selectedAuthority] : []

// After (correct):
selectedAuthorities: props.selectedAuthority ? props.selectedAuthority.split(',').filter(a => a) : []
```

### What This Fixes:
1. âœ… Multiple authority selections now work
2. âœ… Multiple track selections now work
3. âœ… Correct API queries are generated: `(cr4cc_authority eq 'QLD' or cr4cc_authority eq 'VIC' or cr4cc_authority eq 'NSW')`
4. âœ… Data loads properly when multiple filters are selected
5. âœ… Selections persist correctly when navigating or refreshing
