# Race Management SPFx v1.0.11 Release

**Release Date:** December 19, 2024

## üêõ Bug Fixes

### Multi-Select Dropdown Debug Version
- **Issue:** Multi-select dropdown still not working in v1.0.10
- **Changes:** 
  - Added console logging to debug what values are being passed
  - Handles both cases: when `option.selected` is undefined and when it has a value
  - Uses toggle logic when `option.selected` is undefined
  - Uses explicit add/remove logic when `option.selected` is defined
- **Debug Output:** Check browser console for "Authority change:" and "Track change:" logs

## üìã Technical Details

### Changes in v1.0.11:
1. **Enhanced dropdown onChange handlers** with debugging:
   ```typescript
   console.log('Authority change:', {
     key: option.key,
     selected: option.selected,
     text: option.text,
     index: index
   });
   
   // Handle both undefined and defined cases
   if (option.selected === undefined) {
     // Toggle logic
   } else {
     // Use option.selected value
   }
   ```

2. **Defensive Programming**:
   - Checks if `option.selected` is undefined
   - Falls back to toggle logic if property not available
   - Prevents duplicate additions and removals

## ‚úÖ Testing with Debug Output

After deployment:
1. **Open Browser Developer Console** (F12)
2. **Test Authority Dropdown**:
   - Click on Authority dropdown
   - Select an item
   - Look for console output like:
     ```
     Authority change: {key: "NSW", selected: true, text: "New South Wales", index: 0}
     ```
   - Note the value of `selected` property
3. **Test Track Dropdown**:
   - Same process, look for "Track change:" logs
4. **Report Back**:
   - What does the `selected` property show? (true/false/undefined)
   - Does it change when selecting vs deselecting?

## üîÑ Debug Information Needed
