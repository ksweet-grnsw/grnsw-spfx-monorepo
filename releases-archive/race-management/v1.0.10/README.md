# Race Management SPFx v1.0.10 Release

**Release Date:** December 19, 2024

## 🐛 Bug Fixes

### Multi-Select Dropdown Fix with Cache Busting
- **Issue:** v1.0.9 changes may not have been visible due to SharePoint caching
- **Solution:** 
  - Incremented version to 1.0.10 to force cache refresh
  - Deep cleaned build artifacts including node_modules cache
  - Uses `option.selected` property correctly for multi-select handling
- **Implementation:** Same code as v1.0.9 but with proper version increment for cache busting

## 📋 Technical Details

### Changes from v1.0.8:
1. **Corrected dropdown onChange handlers** in `RaceMeetings.tsx`:
   - Uses `option.selected` boolean to determine if adding or removing
   - When `option.selected` is true, item is being selected (add to array)
   - When `option.selected` is false, item is being deselected (remove from array)
   - Removed preventDefault and other workarounds

### Build Information:
- Built with extra deep clean: `rm -rf lib temp dist sharepoint/solution/*.sppkg node_modules/.cache && gulp clean`
- Built with `gulp bundle --ship` and `gulp package-solution --ship`
- SharePoint Framework version: 1.21.1
- Node version: 22.17.1
- TypeScript version: 5.3.3
- Version properly synchronized between package.json (1.0.10) and package-solution.json (1.0.10.0)
- JavaScript bundle hash changed to ensure new code is loaded

### Known Issues:
- ESLint warnings for `any` types and `void` operators (non-critical)
- These warnings do not affect functionality
