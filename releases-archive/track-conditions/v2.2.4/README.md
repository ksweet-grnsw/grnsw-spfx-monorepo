# Track Conditions SPFx v2.2.4 Release

**Release Date:** December 12, 2024

## CRITICAL FIX
**This release fixes the version mismatch issue where package.json had version 2.1.0 while package-solution.json had 2.2.3.0**

## What's Fixed
- **Version Synchronization**: Both package.json and package-solution.json now correctly show version 2.2.3
- **Package Version**: The .sppkg file now correctly embeds version 2.2.3.0 (will display properly in SharePoint)
- **Historical Pattern Analyzer**: Shows all 22 tracks with proper error handling
- **Custom Group**: Configured for "GRNSW Tools" section

## Bug Fixes (from v2.2.3)
- **Historical Pattern Analyzer**:
  - Displays all 22 tracks in dropdown (Albion Park through Wentworth Park)
  - Shows user-friendly message when no track selected
  - Prevents UNKNOWN_ERROR when no tracks selected
  - Validates track selection before API calls

## Technical Details
- **Build Version:** 2.2.3 (synchronized across all config files)
- **SharePoint Version:** Will display as 2.2.3.0 in App Catalog
- **Build Warnings:** 60 ESLint warnings (expected for Dataverse null handling)
- **Node Version:** 22.17.1
- **TypeScript Version:** 5.3.3

## Installation Instructions
1. **DELETE the old app from App Catalog first** (critical step!)
2. Upload `track-conditions-spfx-v2.2.4-PROD.sppkg` to your SharePoint App Catalog
3. The version should now correctly show as **2.2.3.0**
4. Deploy the solution (check "Make this solution available to all sites")

## What Was Wrong Before
- package.json had version "2.1.0" while package-solution.json had "2.2.3.0"
- SPFx build process uses package.json version, causing the mismatch
- This is why SharePoint showed old version even with updated package-solution.json
