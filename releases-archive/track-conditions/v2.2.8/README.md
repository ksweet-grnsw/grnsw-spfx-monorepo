# Track Conditions SPFx v2.2.8 Release Notes

**Release Date:** December 13, 2024  
**Package:** track-conditions-spfx.sppkg  
**Version:** 2.2.8

## üîß CRITICAL FIX: Default Track Property Persistence

This release fixes the issue where the selected default track was not persisting when the page was republished or refreshed.

## üêõ Bug Fixes

### Historical Pattern Analyzer - Default Track Persistence
- **Fixed**: Default track selection now properly persists across page refreshes
- **Fixed**: Added `defaultTrack` property to manifest.json (was missing)
- **Fixed**: Component now properly initializes with the default track on page load
- **Fixed**: Both single track (defaultTrack) and multi-track (defaultTracks) selections are saved
- **Improved**: Added debug logging to help diagnose any remaining issues

### Technical Changes
1. **Manifest Update**: Added missing `defaultTrack` property to preconfiguredEntries
2. **Component Initialization**: Improved logic to properly use defaultTrack on initial load
3. **Property Persistence**: Now saves both defaultTrack and defaultTracks when user changes selection
4. **Debug Logging**: Added console logs to track property values during initialization

## üìã How It Works Now

When you set a default track in the property pane:
1. The value is saved to the `defaultTrack` property
2. On page load, the component checks for `defaultTrack` first
3. If a default track is set, it automatically loads that track's data
4. The selection persists even after page republish

## üîç Debugging

If you still experience issues, check the browser console for these debug messages:
- `HistoricalPatternAnalyzer - componentDidMount`
- `Default Track: [track name]`
- `Selected Tracks in State: [array of tracks]`
