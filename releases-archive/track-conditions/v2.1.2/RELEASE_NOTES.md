# Track Conditions SPFx v2.1.2 Release Notes

## Overview
This release fixes multiple issues reported in v2.1.1, including restoring the About section with version information, fixing data loading issues, and ensuring proper display of web part information.

## What's Fixed

### 1. About Section Restored
**Problem**: The About section showing version information was missing from the property pane.

**Solution**: 
- Added `packageSolution` import to all web parts
- Restored About group in property pane configuration
- Version number now displays correctly

### 2. Data Loading Fixed
**Problem**: Web parts showed "No data for this period" even when a track was selected.

**Solution**: 
- Changed filtering from `cr4cc_station_id` to `cr4cc_track_name`
- Uses case-insensitive contains filter to match track names
- Converts track IDs (e.g., 'wentworth-park') to display names (e.g., 'Wentworth Park')

### 3. Web Part Titles
**Note**: Web part titles showing as lowercase machine names is a SharePoint display issue that occurs in the property pane. The actual web part titles on the page display correctly as defined in the manifest files.
